# Ruby Practice

This practice project contains 4 Ruby files for you to read and learn from. They have been heavily commented explaining everything that is going on

Your **mission** is to recreate this project on your own, out of scratch.

1. Start with the `main.rb` file and then dig into `user.rb` and `admin.rb` files. Ones you’re done reading them. Open the `blog_post.rb` file and add your own comments to it based on what you have learned.

   The `User` and `Admin` classes have many additional methods that you should explore.

1. Once you’ve read and re-implemented the project. Start expanding it by adding additional functionality to all of the classes. Maybe, refactor the `main.rb` into an `App` class.

1. Your last step for additional practice is to start a new project based on a different real world concept and try to model it using everything you have learned about Ruby so far.

Make sure to **fork** and **clone** this repo. And open a **pull request** for each of the 3 phases.
